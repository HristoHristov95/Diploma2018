So basically this is my diploma work and it creates a Word file from your speech. Using a dictionary with words. Its created using
MFC - Windows API. A simple application just a preview of the code. If you desire to compile and run it you will need these
libraries added to your project, else it won't run at all. 
  Here they are :
      •	MSWORD.OLB
      •	WinMM.lib
      •	kernel32.lib
      •	user32.lib
      •	comdlg32.lib
Also copy paste the Dictionary file ("FindServices8.grxml") to your debug/release folder.
